# Folder Contents
This folder contains the code we used to convert the datasets into their DFE/EDFE format and to test compressibility.

The dfe.py and edfe.py file contain the encoding algorithm used for DFE/EDFE.

The other python files are used to both compress the dataset with Zstandard, GZIP, and ZIP, and to convert the dataset into DFE/EDFE
