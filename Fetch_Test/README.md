# Folder Contents
This folder contains the code we used to conduct the fetch tests.

The decompress.py python file is used to decompress one of our DFE encoded datasets into a normal csv file for testing. Run this file first to get the dataset required for testing.

The fetch_test.cpp code is used to conduct (and time) the fetch test. Compile and run this after running the python file to run the test

# How to run
- Run decompress.py
- Compile/run fetch_test.cpp
